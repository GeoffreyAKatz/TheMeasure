 * The :15 successfully resonated with younger viewers aged 21-49, suggesting the campaign is achieving its objective at reaching a youthful demographic.
 * Viewer comments reflect a surprisingly funny creative that also reflected the true nature of the product in a positive way. Many appreciated how the ad embraced the glory of the product in its natural, wiggly state straight from the can.

A few additional insights via iSpot’s Ace Metrix :

 * The interesting music and dancing characters were excellent attention-getters: 22% of survey respondents said the characters were the single best thing about the ad, while 16% thought the music was the best aspect.
 * The funny scenes were engaging to many viewers, with most also feeling that the ad educated well on the cash back opportunities.

 * Although enjoying great appeal among NBA fans (of any level), the new spot also resonated well across age/gender and ethnicity, suggesting opportunity to air it broadly beyond NBA programming
 * Emotional profiling reveals the new ad connected through the humor while sparking some “curiosity”
 * Gen pop viewers engaged with both Curry (and other characters) and the music, both of which were disproportionately forward vs. other discount website ads from the past year.",__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/11/pexels-kampus-production-5935240.jpg,0,post,published,,public,all,2022-11-03T13:10:16.000Z,2022-11-03T20:40:52.000Z,2022-11-03T13:12:51.000Z,,,,,,6359c410975d780031398a07,1,6363bf7105d727003d788ff5,b55209b3-8bb9-4877-a6dd-45943bd090a2,New TV Advertiser: Fi Collars,new-tv-advertiser-fi-collars,"{""version"":""0.3.1"",""atoms"":[[""soft-return"","""",{}]],""cards"":[[""html"",{""html"":""<div style=\""position:relative; width:100%; padding-top:56.25%; padding-bottom:40px;\""><iframe src=\""https://www.ispot.tv/share/2TBY\"" style=\""position:absolute; top:0; right:0; left:0; bottom:0; width:100%; height:100%;\"" frameborder=\""0\"" scrolling=\""no\"" allowfullscreen=\""\""></iframe></div>""}]],""markups"":[[""a"",[""href"",""http://ispot.tv""]],[""a"",[""href"",""https://www.ispot.tv/ad/2TBY/fi-series-3-not-just-a-dog""]],[""em""]],""sections"":[[1,""p"",[[0,[0],1,""iSpot.tv""],[0,[],0,"" data reveals a recent newcomer to the national TV advertising scene: Fi Collars, which began airing its spot “Not Just a Dog” on Oct. 24.

A new report from VIZIO (using Inscape ACR data) showcases how brands can find football audiences elsewhere as budgets potentially tighten in 2023. Some of the big takeaways around audience behaviors for both NFL and college football audiences, and how brands can adjust ad buys to reduce waste:

 * Among all NFL viewers, 21% of time is spent watching sports but 79% is spent watching non-sports programming (all of which is going to be cheaper than NFL inventory).
 * While college football viewers spend slightly more time (22.4%) watching sports, that still leaves 77.6% of the time where other non-sports programming is on TV.
 * Across all active VIZIO TVs, just 17.4% of watch-time is dedicated to sports, which leaves a staggering 82.6% of time on non-sports programs; yet most major advertisers are still hyper-focused on expensive live sports as a source of impressions.",__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/vizio-football-graphics--2-.png,0,post,published,,public,all,2022-12-06T23:15:25.000Z,2022-12-06T23:24:07.000Z,2022-12-06T23:24:07.000Z,,,,,,6359c410975d780031398a07,1,638fcf34ae6210003dcd7ecd,bc212277-e6fc-425b-8a49-db4a3d0a36d8,"NFL, College Football Audience Overlap Minimizes Incremental Reach (Report)",nfl-college-football-audience-overlap-minimizes-incremental-reach,"{""version"":""0.3.1"",""atoms"":[],""cards"":[],""markups"":[[""a"",[""href"",""https://www.tvrev.com/special-reports/p/advertising-to-football-fans-who-they-are-what-they-watch-and-how-to-reach-them""]],[""a"",[""href"",""http://inscape.tv""]],[""em""]],""sections"":[[1,""p"",[[0,[],0,""NFL and college football TV audiences aren't the separate islands that conventional wisdom has long suggested.""]]],[1,""p"",[[0,[],0,""A ""],[0,[0],1,""new report from VIZIO Ads""],[0,[],0,"" (using ""],[0,[1],1,""Inscape""],[0,[],0,"" ACR data) spotlights how these audiences overlap significantly, and how a very small portion of TV audiences ""],[0,[2],1,""exclusively""],[0,[],0,"" watch college football over the NFL.

It’s Just “Max” Now

Millions of “Disco Bros” fans are bound to be disappointed by news that the probable new name of the HBO Max/Discovery+ collab is going to be “Max.” (There’s a pesky bit of business about a pharma company that owns the rights to the Max URL that needs to be dealt with first.)

Still no word on pricing, or what happens to all those Discovery+ subscribers who were happily paying $5/month for the ad-supported version. Will they be grandfathered into the new app, and if so for how long?

It seems there was also much debate on the wisdom of removing “HBO” from the app’s name, given that it is such an iconic brand.

But I think that moving away from HBO is the right move, especially now.

Why It Matters

HBO has been around for close to 40 years and the service has not changed dramatically since the early 00s when it became the home of “quality TV.”

And that’s the thing.

People have had almost 20 years to decide whether HBO and its style of programming is for them. At its peak, the service had around 40 million subs—roughly 35 million via MVPDs and 5 million via its standalone HBO Now app.

Which means that all those other people had decided that HBO was not for them, and so having the name front and center is not going to help lure them in the way that having Discovery and similar less highbrow content will.

As noted here previously, there are a whole lot of people who don’t really get why Bill Hader’s show Barry is supposed to be funny. I mean he kills people, right?

In addition to there being a limited audience for that type of programming, there’s also a whole swath of other streaming services all cranking out HBO type shows. So that the audience has come to think of them as “streaming type shows” not “HBO type shows” which further dilutes the appeal of having HBO in the name.

Finally, there’s the fallout from the massive confusion AT&T spawned when trying to roll out HBO Max, with multiple variations of HBO-branded apps scattered about—HBO Go, HBO Now, HBO-not-Max, HBO on your cable program guide…

So there will be real value in not having yet another HBO-named app.

From a content perspective, it will be interesting to see what is included. How much CNN (if any) makes it in, will there be any pickups from TBS and TNT—that sort of thing.

I’ll also be looking to see if Discovery+’s linear channels make the migration over. I strongly suspect that they will and that Max will have even more linear channels for its library content.

That’s a trend we first noted in our recent report FASTs Are The New Cable, and the consensus seems to be that all of the remaining big SVOD services will soon roll out linear channels too, joining Discovery+, Paramount+ and Peacock.

Consumers seem to like them, they are a great way to surface library content, and, if you are running advertising, they increase time spent on platform.

They also cut down on decision paralysis, or, to paraphrase something I’d heard from a number of executives, “Why would I make someone who likes watching The Simpsons pick an episode every time they turn on the TV when I can just give them a Simpsons channel?”

So there’s that too.

What You Need To Do About It

If you are WBD, the launch of the new app is a great time to pick up new subscribers and retain old ones.

Given that there aren’t that many Discovery+ subs, maybe grandfather them in for life at the OG price, provided they don’t give up the subscription.

As far as price, the key here is do no harm. Given the wide range of programming options you have on offer, you have a great argument that you are one of the only apps someone needs. Now sell it at a price point that doesn’t scare people off of that proposition.

Keep up with the bundling deals (e.g., Amazon) and specials that lock people in for a year or more. Your ad sales teams will thank you.

Remember that interface is key and that the number one issue people have with streaming apps is discovery (lower case “D”) —they can never find the shows they want. Solve that and you will have subscribers for life.

Get some live sports rights too. Nothing creates stickiness like live sports, plus all those ad-free subscribers have to watch ads during sporting events, so it increases your audience, something that is going to prove to be very important, especially if not all that many people switch over to the ad-supported version.

Finally, you’ve been on a roll with programming, keeping the HBO legacy alive. Keep that up—even if a big chunk of your potential audience doesn’t get why Barry is funny, buzzy shows like Succession and White Lotus gets you the sort of free marketing that builds empires.



2. RSNs Bumpy Move To Streaming

As has been noted here many times, in the grand scheme of things, regional sports networks (RSNs) are in many ways far more important to the survival of the TV industry than big deals like NFL rights.

Not that the latter is unimportant, it’s just that RSN fans tend to be hardcore.

They are fans of a particular pro baseball, basketball or hockey team and will gladly pay to watch every single game their team plays. This makes them a very valuable subscriber base, as they are highly unlikely to churn. At least not during the season anyway.

Which is why we’re watching two developments this week.

On the one hand, Diamond, the company that’s running Sinclair’s RSN’s and moving them all to streaming apps has been doing its best to disassociate itself with Sinclair and the $9.6 billion in debt it went into to acquire said RSNs.

On the other, NBCU seems ready to move its five RSNs onto Peacock and has been busily negotiating those deals.

Two steps forward, one step back.

Why It Matters

Let’s look at the two deals in question first.

It seems that MLB teams in particular are somewhat leery of Sinclair, given that they are so deep in the hole. The fear being that Sinclair will make irrational moves in order to guarantee profitability. Irrational to MLB owners, anyway.

While there is a new CEO at Diamond Sports, the company that runs the streaming partnership between Ballys and Sinclair, it’s unclear if that alone will result in happier MLB franchise owners. Yes, the new CEO, David Preschlack comes from NBC and is not beholden to Sinclair, but it’s sort of hard to ignore all that debt.

That said, if anyone needs to reach a new audience via streaming it is Major League Baseball, so perhaps turning a blind eye is a smart move after all, especially since the Bally RSNs are only $20/month, making them accessible to younger fans.

On a brighter note, NBCU is moving its five major market RSNs - two in Northern California, plus Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago—over to Peacock.

This is a great move for all parties involved (detailed explanation here).

The teams in question get a way to reach younger audiences who won’t need to pay over $100/month for cable just to get the RSN (Peacock will be just $10/month) while Peacock gets a whole bunch of new subscribers who are unlikely to churn and, like swallows to Capistrano, will return at the start of every season even if they do.

The RSNs are also good for NBCU’s ad sales team, because even though fans are subscribed to the ad-free version of Peacock, they will still see ads during the games.

So a win all around, unless, of course, you are one of the MVPDs who carry those RSNs, which, by all accounts, are the reason many of those fans still pay for cable.

What You Need To Do About It

If you are Major League Baseball you need to do everything you can to bring in younger fans. Baseball is increasingly viewed as old-school (and not in a good way) so you need to meet that younger audience where they live. Even if it means overlooking the potential impact of all those billions of Sinclairian debt.

If you are NBCU, well done. Not only for all the reasons noted above, but because RSNs are very much in keeping with NBCU’s brand.

If you are the remaining RSNs, streaming is where everything is going. If you don’t want to go the switchover alone, I suspect you will have no shortage of potential partners, including almost all the big SVOD services and FASTs. Just remember, the longer you wait the harder it gets.

Finally, if you do launch a streaming RSN, remember that there are a whole lot of cool things you can do that take advantage of the fact that streaming is digital and interactive.

It’s worth digging into the entire “rewind” piece on the company’s blog, but as social video continues to grow — and even rival TV in some age groups — we wanted to pull out some of the biggest takeaways from 2022 below.

Shorts Are Tall For YouTube Creators

Honing in on U.S. YouTube channels, eight of the top 10 videos were shorts (under one-minute long), with all eight shorts uploaded by individual creators. Tops among those was Daniel LaBelle’s If Cleaning Was a Timed Sport. Part 2, which generated over 565 million views.

Creator content and shorts have grown at a staggering pace in recent years, and are increasingly successful ways for brands to get in front of audiences on social video as well. There’s an avenue for brands and publishers here as well — both Coke and ESPN’s SportsNation also had videos among the top 10 — though working with established and popular accounts like the LeoNata Family (13.5 billion YouTube views last year, and a 165% views increase year-over-year) could be the easier road in.

Music’s Global Nature

When looking at the top music videos on YouTube in 2022, Tubular noticed a focus away from U.S. performers. Ranked by V30 (views in the first 30 days from upload), non-U.S. artists like BLACKPINK, BTS and PSY were able to differentiate themselves above others.

Latin music also exploded in 2022, as nearly 34K uploaded videos amounted to more than 18 billion views for the year.

Interestingly, however, things were more U.S.- and U.K.-based when looking at sounds utilized for social videos. There, Harry Styles’s “As It Was” scored a dominating 27.6 billion views, followed by Lizzo’s “About Damn Time.” Styles also had over 1 million videos created using his music last year, with half of those utilizing “As It Was.”

Social Video Fueling Retail Comebacks

As Tubular notes in its “rewind” blog, brands like Abercrombie & Fitch and UGG both surged in 2022 due at least in part to social video popuarlity.

Abercrombie was particularly aware of the TikTok conversation going on around its brand and leaned into the video platform’s ability to drive both talk and sales among users. Engagements around hashtags like #abercrombie or #abercrombiehaul or #abercrombieandfitch climbed 260% year-over-year in Nov. 2022.

Twarog’s overall audience has grown significantly: According to CreatorIQ, he’s had a 60% growth in YouTube subscribers since November, and an astounding 794% increase in monthly views.

YouTuber Nick White, who shares videos about coding, also benefited from a ChatGPT bump: His “How I Coded an Entire Website Using ChatGPT” published in early January led to a huge spike in monthly views, with his January view total 332.3% higher than the average of the five previous months per CreatorIQ.

It’s not all tutorials - creators are having fun with AI too, like food influencer Patrick Zeinali, whose “Robot Vs Human Bake Off” has generated over 38 million views since it was posted on Dec. 12, 18.4 million of which occurred in the first 30 days per Tubular’s V30 rating.

The fight, which took place in Saudi Arabia and was available to watch via pay-per-view, drew a global audience — and you can be sure the people watching weren’t just boxing enthusiasts. One reason it was so hotly anticipated is due to the influencer status Fury and Paul both hold, something the World Boxing Council publicly recognized before as well as after the fight.

Paul made a name for himself as a YouTube star years ago, while Fury has been boxing professionally since 2018 and was a contestant on season five of Love Island UK. And not only that, their rivalry has been going on for years, with two previously scheduled fights having been canceled for various reasons only fueling the fire.

Fury may have a bit more experience under his belt, but Paul is punching higher when it comes to social audiences: According to CreatorIQ, he has 70.1 million followers across social media platforms, compared to Fury’s 5.5 million. The highly publicized fight spurred social audience growth for both: Paul saw a modest increase of 0.43% in followers compared to the week before the bout, while Fury saw a notable 10% growth.

Instagram is the most popular platform for both, and while Paul boasts 22.3 million followers there compared to Fury’s 4.9 million, Fury has him beat for engagement, with an engagement rate of 7.26%, which CreatorIQ considers “excellent,” compared to Paul’s “good” 1.48%.

Both used their social followings to promote the match and drive tune-in, with Paul in particular not pulling any punches: Mere days before the fight, he escalated the rivalry, posting a video to Twitter and Instagram utterly ripping into Fury, proclaiming “This is it, you’re going to be retired from boxing after this.”

And earlier in the week during an interview, Paul referred to Fury’s girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague as the “breadwinner” in their relationship. Well, from a social angle he’s not wrong: Hague, an influencer herself, has 12.3 million followers across social platforms, and an “excellent” Instagram engagement rate of 11.5%, per CreatorIQ — far beyond either Fury or Paul.

Of course, in the end Fury emerged victorious with a split-decision win after eight rounds. But that’s certainly not the last of it: There was a rematch clause in the contract, and Paul already said he intends to make it happen.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552072092-7f9b8d63efcb?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGJveGluZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2Nzc4Nzk3OTg&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000,0,post,published,,public,all,2023-03-03T21:41:56.000Z,2023-03-03T21:45:06.000Z,2023-03-01T21:43:00.000Z,,,,,,6359c410975d780031398a07,1,64026a79f784d9003d1efb80,10cb20cc-10d2-4c0f-a5e6-00bcdcb7d161,Applebee's Starts Year Rolling With The Stones,applebees-starts-year-rolling-with-the-stones,"{""version"":""0.3.1"",""atoms"":[],""cards"":[[""image"",{""src"":""__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-01-at-10.49.19-AM.png"",""width"":1500,""height"":557,""href"":""http://songtradr.com/""}]],""markups"":[[""a"",[""href"",""http://songtradr.com/""]],[""em""]],""sections"":[[1,""p"",[[0,[],0,""One way brands can get audience attention?

As Songtradr points out, Heineken’s video ad strategy included re-recordings of recognizable songs, allowing it to resonate with a larger audience and see the highest consumer engagement in the category. Doing so was a smart differentiator in an industry that can approach advertising pretty similarly.

Success with music is not just about creating an idea of sonic likeability either. Songtradr cites research from Les Binet that using music can increase an ad campaign’s effectiveness by 20-25%. Since Guinness used more stock music and voiceovers, it didn’t fare as well as its peers who may have utilized more recognizable (and thus, more effective) tracks.

With tightening regulations on data and consumer privacy, skyrocketing costs of traditional advertising platforms and a bevvy or real-world headwinds – from recession-like sentiment to pandemic-driven changes in consumer media habits – it’s harder now than ever for marketers to acquire and engage with customers.

According to a new report from Wunderkind, 86% of U.S. consumers have actually tried to erase their online footprint, and 87% say they will no longer shop with companies they don’t trust to use their data responsibly.

So what is the clear way forward for marketers?

For millennials, marketers have a clear imperative to hit them where it counts – text messaging. In fact, the report noted that, according to OpenMarket, 8 of 10 millennials said they would rather lose the ability to speak than the ability to text! Among all consumers, 41% said they are likely to switch to another brand because they offer text messaging.

Wunderkind found that retailers on average allocate over 10% of their budget to creating and maintaining a quality website. That includes implementing a system that can identify and engage with site visitors, even after they’ve left. After all, 26% of consumers will return and make a purchase on a website after abandoning their cart if retargeted with direct, personalized email.

Given that nearly 70% of eCommerce shopping carts are abandoned before completing a purchase, the tools and strategies outlined in the “The New Performance Marketing Era” guide provide a solid foundation for sustainable growth and scalable success.

Starbucks reigned supreme for the QSR industry, racking up over $294.8 million EMV with nearly 4.7 million estimated impressions. A few more insights:

 * Not only did Starbucks lead for EMV, it boasted a creator count of 30,522 — more than twice as many as No. 2 QSR brand, McDonald’s.
 * However, McDonald’s’ results suggest a more efficient and impactful effort, with over 5 billion impressions and a total EMV of $267.7M—nearly equal to Starbucks’ results with half the creators and posts.
 * Only two other brands managed to rack up more than a billion impressions: Starbucks (4.7 billion) and Chipotle (1.1 billion).

— Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) April 11, 2023

While that price tag seems steep, keep in mind that NFL Sunday Ticket cost nearly $294 per season for the basic plan with DIRECTV, and an extra $102 per season for the premium plan that included both the Red Zone Channel and Fantasy Zone network.

For consumers that also subscribe to YouTube TV, the base option here is actually cheaper than it was last year — until June 6, anyway For the Red Zone bundle, fans will pay about $6 less, again if they’re YouTube TV subscribers and sign up by June 6.

If you really want Sunday Ticket, you’re going to pay for it, whatever the price. Realistically, this is just like any other late-adopter tax, and that’s where YouTube really makes money here. Additionally, they’ll make a ton on new YouTube TV subscriptions. So even where it’s “cheaper” for consumers if they sign up with YouTube TV by June 6, YouTube is still making $63 per month on top of that for the first 10 months, then $73 per month after if they retain those subscribers.

Shakira and Bizzarap’s “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” (or “Out of Your League”) was one of the most-used songs on TikTok earlier in 2023 – according to data from Songtradr – but the Latin hit has yet to be utilized by brands in TV advertising since its early January release.

For advertisers that may want to avoid creating brand confusion with Kroger – or are simply looking for a cheaper alternative – there are options to find similar songs to “Out of Your League.” These tracks can sound like Shakira, and use the song’s 2023 popularity on TikTok as a hook, while also avoiding complete overlap.

For example, Songtradr reveals these characteristics for “Out of Your League,” including higher scores for danceability (78%) and energy (63%).

In the new report TikTok Marketing Best Practices For Food & Beverage Brands, CreatorIQ — TikTok's first official SaaS Creator Marketing partner — examines how Cheetos, OLIPOP and Chobani are motivating creators to endorse their products on TikTok, and measures the outcomes of specific campaigns.

Cheetos uses fun food challenge to spur creator-led content

 * To market their new spicy flavor, Cheetos started a social campaign #CheetosReaperReactions to get food lovers to film their rapid reactions
 * The hashtag became the leading tag for the brand on TikTok and generated $38.6 million earned media value (EMV).

OLIPOP gives creator partners artistic freedom to improve authenticity

 * OLIPOP worked with CreatorIQ to identify and curate creators for their next partnership campaign via creator information and custom questionnaires, and matched creators to specific campaign goals. Identifying the right targets and allowing them to go off script gave way to big payoffs.
 * #OLIPOPPartner hashtags dramatically outperformed those tagged with the secondary campaign term, #OLIPOP.
 * The TikTok campaign generated $25.4M EM (that’s 62% of the brand’s total EMV and 1.8K% more than last year)

Chobani mobilizes creators via competitive cross-platform campaign

 * Chobani worked with Roblox to create “Chobani Oatmilk Cosmic Race” — a race in Roblox universe that took players across the virtual galaxy delivering Chobani Oatmilk to various planets
 * Players took the experience from Roblox to TikTok for post-game content with the hashtag #CatchChobaniOatmilk.
 * As a result of the campaign, Chobani accrued $33.2M EMV, a 278% YoY improvement, and doubled its creator community (which contributed to a 75% YoY increase in post volume).

According to a recent study by CreatorIQ, an end-to-end creator marketing platform powering efforts for over 1,000 brands and agencies, marketers are shifting ad dollars traditionally spent on digital advertising to creator-led marketing initiatives.

Spurred by advancements in measurement that now can attribute sales directly to creator content on social media, 67% of marketers surveyed by CreatorIQ report increasing their investment in influencer marketing from 2022 to 2023. But of those brands whose budgets increased, only 24% are working with a net-new budget and 76% said they were diverting funds from other marketing activities, including digital ads, to creator-led initiatives.

Another upside for brands and creators alike?

The survey found that 77% of respondents said they actively convert creators who share organically about their organization into brand partners, allowing them to tap into something once nearly impossible to find in pitch people – authenticity.

By partnering with VIZIO, Subway saw quick gains in the incremental potential of streaming media alongside their linear TV campaign:

 * By adding CTV video and VIZIO Home Screen, Subway’s campaign reach skyrocketed to nearly 82% of VIZIO TVs — tripling the impact of its linear TV efforts alone.

The consistent rise post-pandemic shows interest in the sport and the game itself appears to be growing. An influx of young stars (there were 33 first-time all-stars this year) helps too, as MLB continues to strive for more youthful audience.

One of Morgan’s top social posts with Nike from June generated an EMV of $123.8k, with  post-level engagement rate of 3.4%, which CreatorIQ considered above average compared to other influencers of a similar sized following.

CreatorIQ also examined Instagram audience growth for a few of the team members. 18-year-old Alyssa Thompson (the first teenager to make the U.S. women’s roster since 1995) stands out with an explosive 140.5% increase in Instagram followers since February 2023. Naomi Girma has grown her Instagram audience by 73%, while Sophia Smith has seen a 33% increase and Trinity Rodman has increased her followers by 19.2% since February. All of them have partnered with brands for various social promotions.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520363909542-9f69145ab443?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE5fHx3b21lbiUyN3MlMjBzb2NjZXJ8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjkwMjE1MjYxfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000,0,post,published,,public,all,2023-07-24T16:07:13.000Z,2023-07-24T17:04:16.000Z,2023-07-24T17:04:16.000Z,Social content from Alex Morgan has  generated over $2 million in earned media value for brands. ,,,,,,1,64bfdc1883f59800019e69c6,492c40e9-e26a-4e82-9e20-97c48922470c,NBC Takes First Place for Most-Watched Networks Last Week,nbc-takes-first-place-for-most-watched-networks-last-week,"{""version"":""0.3.1"",""atoms"":[],""cards"":[[""image"",{""src"":""__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/InscapeTopNetworksJuly17-23.png"",""width"":1018,""height"":1219}]],""markups"":[[""em""],[""a"",[""href"",""http://inscape.tv""]],[""a"",[""href"",""https://www.tvrev.com/news/summer-sports-score-for-tv-watch-time""]]],""sections"":[[1,""p"",[[0,[0],1,""Each week, we""],[0,[],0,"" ""],[0,[0],1,""highlight the most-watched shows and networks using insights from ""],[0,[1,0],2,""Inscape""],[0,[0],0,"", the currency-grade smart TV ACR data provider and data technology division of Vizio.

This signifies strong interest during their respective ""in-season"" windows.

From the start of 2020 through July 30, 2023, Parrot Analytics examined the changes in both supply and demand shares for various release strategies among the 50 most popular streaming original series in the U.S. What they found is that neither binge nor episodic releases are foolproof approaches, and perhaps the hybrid (periodic) release strategy could be the way to go.

 * The supply share, representing the number of series with a binge release that made the top 50, has decreased by 14% (versus a 15% decline in demand share).
 * In that same span, episodic weekly releases saw a 2% decline in supply share and a 3% decline in demand share.
 * Periodic releases, which still often release the majority of its episodes one at a time, rose 16% in supply share and 18% in demand share.

How much of a 'Trump bump' is cable news getting with all this? Inscape examined viewership trends for CNN, Fox News and MSNBC over the last few months as all of this has gone down.

 * Notably, viewership was higher across the board on arraignment days vs. indictment days, perhaps because people were more interested in hearing how Trump would react and plea than learning the nitty gritty details of the charges themselves.
 * Fox News captured more tune-in than CNN and MSNBC by a wide margin, sometimes with a 2-3x higher viewership share, while MSNBC scored slightly higher viewership than CNN for each of the indictment and arraignment days.

Songtradr examined what these song choices have in common – despite genre differences – and how they help to create a uniform brand identity for Taco Bell and its intended audience.

Bludnymph – “FEAST”

 * Used in Taco Bell's top ad of 2023, the 2021 release gained popularity after being used in an episode of Netflix's Heartbreak High, and another bump on TikTok after the Taco Bell commercial aired.
 * The song's TikTok popularity appeals to younger audiences, aligning with Taco Bell's brand goals by using a socially endemic artist and vibrant sonic characteristics.
 * Limited use of the song elsewhere also let the brand carve out a unique association with both the song and artist (who has also pushed the ad herself on social media)

Meet Me @ The Altar: “Say It (To My Face)”

 * Another song choice that aligns with Taco Bell's goals, the pop-punk track appeals to younger consumers with high energy (90/100) and danceability (51/100) for their $2 grilled chicken burrito ad.
 * Taco Bell also capitalized on the song's rising popularity, featuring it in ads shortly before the band's performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, highlighting the strategy of synchronizing music promotion with emerging social trends and moments in culture.

 * At No. 3 is NBC, with its 6.43% viewership share driven in part by Today, America’s Got Talent and NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt.
 * HGTV (No. 10) and History (No. 22) were the only two networks to increase ranking position week-over-week, but HGTV’s viewership share actually decreased while History’s went up a tad.

 * Target used the NOTD song “AM:PM” for its “Back to School Anthem” ad. The track appeals best with consumers aged 18 to 34, but also aligns with teens (13-17) and young parents (35-44)
 * Walmart takes a similar approach with “Back to School - Mom Chat” — one of three ads featured in its back-to-school campaign — which features “Shut Down” by BLACKPINK.

 * Walmart also doubled down on advertising for parents with “That's A Wrap” — featuring ""This Is What Love Looks Like"" by Carlton Jumel Smith, Cold Diamond & Mink — which shows overwhelmingly higher confidence levels with listeners aged 35 to 65
 * Both JCPenney and Kohl’s took a similar tack with their campaigns.

More and more, advertisers are recognizing the significant influence of sonic branding, emphasizing the role of music in ads to create stronger connections with audiences, boost brand affinity, and drive purchase intent.

 * Insurance brands reduced TV ad impressions during men's college basketball games by 29% YoY, though brands like New York Life and Humana (among others) still saw increases during the sport compared to the same period in 2022.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1633158829585-23ba8f7c8caf?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGluc3VyYW5jZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2OTU4NDI4MzB8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000,0,post,published,,public,all,2023-09-27T19:24:55.000Z,2023-09-27T19:28:29.000Z,2023-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,,,,,,,1,6515c0a1c70a8e000187e18a,d8962336-a8a0-4048-89eb-1358eb3f0ad4,Wireless Brands Are Singing Older Tunes,wireless-brands-are-singing-older-tunes,"{""version"":""0.3.1"",""atoms"":[[""soft-return"","""",{}]],""cards"":[[""image"",{""src"":""__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/chart--1-.png"",""width"":682,""height"":421,""caption"":""<em>Data provided by Songtradr</em>"",""href"":""songtradr.com""}]],""markups"":[[""a"",[""href"",""http://songtradr.com/""]],[""strong""],[""a"",[""href"",""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC5E8ie2pdM""]],[""a"",[""href"",""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp0a2TCHcx4""]]],""sections"":[[1,""p"",[[0,[],0,""Ads for wireless companies are everywhere on TV, but it takes more than just a lot of ad airings to stand out.

Songtradr recently used its AI sonic analysis technology to evaluate the songs licensed by some of the most-seen wireless ads on TV since the start of 2022, honing in on some key trends:

 * The music choices of wireless ads were most favorable to older millennials and Gen X audiences; ""The Best"" by Tina Turner (used in a T-Mobile spot) scored 80% favorability among older millennials, and ""Go Where You Wanna Go"" by The Mamas & the Papas (used in a Lively spot) earned a 90% favorability rating among Gen X viewers.

Entertainingly, that conversation was followed directly – at 10:29 p.m. – by an ad for the social video app, “Meet Jessie Whittington.” The spot doesn’t address the debate, but plays as a spot geared toward the Fox News audience, revolving around a soap entrepreneur in Mississippi.

The Whittington ad accounts for nearly 38% of ad impressions in the timeframe.

TikTok has focused heavily on cable news networks and broadcast in that timeframe as well. Fox News is the No. 1 network by share of TikTok TV ad impressions since June 1, with 18.9%, while CNN is No. 2 at 15.2%. CBS, Fox, ABC and MSNBC are all among the top 10 as well.

Given the nature of the U.S. news discourse around TikTok right now, perhaps the app figures the ads move toward “setting the record straight” immediately after on-air critiques. If audiences are most likely to retain the last thing they hear about TikTok, that could be the entrepreneurship-focused ads.

Audiences Respond Well to the Ads, Too

iSpot Creative Assessment data shows the spots are finding some success around narrative, too.

 * The top emotional response from survey respondents around the Whittington spot was for its narrative, and 29% of respondents said the message was the single best thing.
 * “Patriotic Kenny and Amanda” came off as both heartfelt and inspired to survey respondents, and the single best thing was the message there as well, according to 36% of those surveyed.
 * The ad was also 19% more likeable than other technology ads since June 1.

So for now, at least, it seems that TikTok is fine with the extra publicity, as it successfully finds ways to spin that toward more positive attention through its ads.

 * Apple TV+ had the largest share of audience demand in the U.S. last quarter concentrated among shows that released new episodes in the last six months – not surpising given the considerably smaller library of Apple TV+ compared to its rivals.
 * Disney+ had the smallest share of audience demand in the US last quarter for shows that released new episodes beyond that six month mark.
 * This chart presents the demand share for series that aired a new episode either in the last 12 or six months as of September 30, 2023, according to Parrot Analytics. Demand is expressed as a share of the total demand for a platform TV catalog. In essence, it helps provide clarity into whether or not a platform is mostly relying on freshly released new TV content or slightly older programming.

",6540205b53718500015cceba,"While Taylor Swift is everywhere between her record-setting tour, album drops (both new and re-releases) and the Eras Tour in movie theaters – one place you don't see much of her is on TV – apart from some recent NFL Sundays.

Data from Songtradr reveals that the star's music actually hasn't been licensed for a single TV show or movie since 2008, when her music was used here and there during episodes of 90210 and The Hills.

 * TV exposure via ads has also been pretty limited as well, with Capital One being the only brand partner in commercials since 2020.
 * Capital One has also done its part to promote the Eras Tour movie event.
 * With Swift now officially a billionaire, and seemingly printing money with her music and tours, you could argue she's beyond the point of really needing music licensing, since she's arguably doing more for the brand than they could possibly do for her.
 * However, brands can use data from Songtradr to identify other music that Swift's audience is listening to, or sounds that might fit the same mold – and are more likely to be licensed.

Free ad-supported streaming television, or FAST, has become quite the trendy topic of conversation throughout Hollywood in recent years. And to begin understanding the consumer use case for FAST, we can explore what audiences are actually watching on the platforms.

 * The chart above shows the total demand for all shows and movies available on four major FAST platforms (Tubi, The Roku Channel, Pluto TV and Freevee) in the U.S. in August, according to Parrot Analytics.
 * Tubi (Fox) leads the way in terms of total demand, with a decided movie focus – something also seen with Pluto (Paramount) and Freevee (Amazon).
 * Roku, meanwhile, sits at No. 2 in terms of overall demand, with a larger focus on TV than competitors.
 * Understanding what types of content audiences are most seeking out on these platforms can help most effectively direct ad dollars as brands and agencies invest more heavily into FASTs.
